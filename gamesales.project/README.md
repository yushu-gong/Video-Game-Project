**Dataset Description**
This dataset is download from Kaggle, the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/video-games-sales. This dataset contain the number of units sold (Main region sales and global sales, measurement unit is million), revenue generated, and other key metrics, such as game publishers, platforms, release year, ect.

**Data Cleaning:**
The dataset is organized with a high level of cleanliness. To ensure its integrity, it's necessary to address unknown values and eliminate duplicates. The primary emphasis of data collection spans from 1980 to 2020, the dataset has fewer games post-2016. To maintain the consistency of our analysis, I have opted to exclude data recorded after 2016.

**Research Question:**
What is the relationship between regional and global game sales, and how do genres impact on global sales?

Relationship between regional sales and global sales:
To answer this question, the first thing is to have an overview of global sales and sales in different regions. I have created a bar plot to visualize this situation. From here, we can notice that North America is the main contributor to the global game market, followed by Europe. Japan is the third-largest market, but it has different popular game trends compared to the first two regions. Then, I have created a heatmap to test the correlation and validate the interpretation. Atfer that, I have done literature review to find the reason why have this phenomenon. 
The three primary video game markets consist of economically developed regions, enabling a significant portion of the population to afford gaming consoles, PCs, and video games, thereby contributing to robust sales. Notably, both North America and many European countries share English as a dominant language and possess similar cultural backgrounds. This shared language facilitates the distribution of games with minimal localization efforts. Furthermore, the cultural similarities between these regions lead to shared preferences for specific genres, gaming platforms, gameplay styles, and storytelling themes.In contrast, Japanese video games often incorporate cultural elements and storytelling styles more tailored to a Japanese audience. Language differences serve as a potential barrier, as Japanese players may prefer game versions and platforms in their native language, influencing the correlation between the Japanese video game market and other regions.

How different genre influence the global sales:
To address this question, I created a bar plot to identify which genre of games had a significant influence on global sales during this time span. By comparing the total game count, total game sales, and average game sales, I inferred that action games have been popular in the recent two decades. However, the genre with the highest sales is platform games. To understand the reasons behind this, I drew a line plot to trace the development of these two types of games in this time frame. Before 2000, platform game sales were higher than action games. The main reason for this was Nintendo's release of a series of successful platform games, such as Super Mario Bros, which attracted a large number of loyal fans. The easy mechanics made it accessible to players of all ages. After 2000, with the advancement of technology and the introduction of 3D graphics, there was a shift towards more immersive action games that incorporated cinematic storytelling elements, engaging players in compelling narratives. However, the proliferation of available games led to a saturated market with intense competition. In such a competitive landscape, individual games faced challenges in standing out and achieving high sales figures. Nevertheless, after 2000, the most popular game genre is action.

**Significance Test**
I conducted a Kruskal-Wallis Test to assess the impact of game genre on global game sales and investigated the effect size. The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric statistical method designed for comparing differences among three or more groups, particularly in situations where the data deviates from a normal distribution or demonstrates variance heterogeneity. This test is applied to determine whether significant differences exist among different groups. In my analysis, I utilized sales figures from different game genres and global sales. The results indicated a significant impact of game genre on global sales, with an effect size of 0.033.

**Future work:**
In future work, I aim to precisely determine the effect size of various game genres on global sales. However, this aspect remains unfinished at the moment. Challenges encountered include the non-normal distribution of my dataset and the unequal row counts between game genre sales and global sales, rendering the application of the Spearman correlation test unfeasible. Despite attempts with alternative tests, none have proven successful thus far. Further exploration and refinement of methodologies will be crucial to overcoming these challenges and obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the effect sizes associated with different game genres on global sales.

**Limitations**
The dataset lacks comprehensive documentation from its author, leaving uncertainty regarding how game genres were determined. The absence of clarity raises questions about potential genre overlaps, such as between action and adventure games.
The dataset's temporal scope spans 1980-2016, presenting a limitation in reflecting recent developments. Given the rapidly evolving nature of the gaming industry, the dataset may not capture the latest trends and changes in recent years.
Acknowledging a limited proficiency in data science, the analysis strives for depth but may be constrained by a shallower understanding. Recognizing this limitation, continuous improvement is anticipated in future analyses.
